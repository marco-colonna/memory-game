# Concentration (Memory Game)

Concentration is a memory game written in x86 assembly language.

## Description

Created for the final project in my Computer Logic Design and Assembly language course.

"This is a memory game in which you guess two cards.
If the faces of the cards match, you win the pair
and they remain face up. Dont waste a turn!"

## Installation and Usage

TODO: TASM and DOSBox guide

## Project Status

Additional development of this project will be slow as it was created for a course I have now completed.

I would like to use this project to stay familiar with assembly language by adding features and changes periodically.
